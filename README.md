NYBW2020-Gitcoin-Hackathon-Bounty
Quantstamp Prize Bounty
500 DAI

## Challenge Description
All too often we see projects that undervalue quality testing. Quality testing saves you and your team time when maintaining code and reduces risk when adding new features. We want to see hackers better develop this highly marketable skill. When you create quality tests, everyone wins. Submissions with the highest quality testing will win the 500DAI bounty.

## Submission Requirements
Submit your project‚Äôs full test suite with 80% or better test coverage. 
We would like to review the actual tests done. This bounty will only relate to the smart contracts of the project. Please note that numbers don‚Äôt point to quality.

- Submit any relevant documentation or specifications. 
- Submit a print out the %Stmts %Branches %Funcs %Lines and Uncovered Lines. 
- Include your full project that the test suite relates to
- Have clear instructions on how to run the test suite

## Submission Deadline
May 29th, 2020

## Judging Criteria
Having a high-quality test suite‚Äîone that includes unit, integration and functional tests‚Äîis essential for projects. Tests should have assertions that check effects of the executed code in case of a successful transaction as well as a revert message in case of a rejected transaction. Writing such assertions would be cumbersome without a clear technical specification that lists all system requirements. Don‚Äôt write tests just to reach 100% coverage, write tests to find bugs. Your submission will be judged qualitatively and only those with 80% or better coverage will be accepted. 

## Winner Announcement Date
We will review all hackathon entries in the week following May 29th and will announce a winner by June 12th or sooner.
